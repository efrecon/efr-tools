This project hosts a number of libraries to ease development of [Tcl](http://wiki.tcl.tk/) projects. Apart from the libraries, you will also find a number of full-scale applications that might be of interest. Applications benefit from a [DirectoryStructure](DirectoryStructure.md) that scales with the project and that favours reuse of code.

  * [til](http://code.google.com/p/efr-tools/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Ftil) has been migrated from its old location at sourceforge.  Note that the version found here contains a number of additions, so you should really replace any old installation by the one contained here.
  * [efr-lib](http://code.google.com/p/efr-tools/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fefr-lib) contains the code that was formerly available from my [homepage](http://www.sics.se/~emmanuel/?Code). Again, code here is newer than what is available from the home page.
  * The [ContextManager](ContextManager.md) is a generic server for storing, reacting and integrating all data from a set of sensors and actuators. The manager is to be compared with cloud services such as [cosm](http://cosm.com/), though providing a context and thus being able to answer questions such as "give me all lamps in that room/floor/house".  It integrates with a number of cloud services, including [Twitter](Twitter.md), Cosm and Google Calendar, but also with tiny sensors running [Contiki](ContikiBridge.md).
